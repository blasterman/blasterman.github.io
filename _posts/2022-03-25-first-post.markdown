Today marks the first day of that I've started my own website. While the impetus to create this website was spurred out of a desire to create and post write-ups of rooms and lessons I've participated in on my journey through cybersecurity, this place will also serve as a hub or collection of other interesting or fun topics that I would like to share with others.

Looking forward to many posts ahead! 😁
