Hello! This is my write-up for the THM room "Upload Vulnerabilities" (and also my first one overall).

The room can be found at this link: [https://tryhackme.com/room/uploadvulns](https://tryhackme.com/room/uploadvulns)

Enjoy! üòÅ

### Discovering the Filters:

To begin the process of identifying how I would go about gaining access to the machine, I first needed to ascertain what backend the server is using to display the website. The lesson tips me off to this so I figure it would be a good idea to check. A simple intercept with BurpSuite can tell me this:


![First burp intercept](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/first_burp_intercept.png)


From line 5 we can see that something called Express is powering the display of the page. A quick search online reveals that Express is a web framework for Node.js, a JavaScript framework. This tells me that the .php extension that I‚Äôve been using in the lesson prior won‚Äôt work here; I‚Äôll have to use a script written in the language the framework is using.

With that out of the way, it‚Äôs time to get hands-on with the enumeration!

***

I need to find what, if any, file upload filters are being employed by the server and/or webpage. I‚Äôll start by first uploading a jpg picture of a gem that I grabbed from the internet. Upon selecting it from the file explorer prompt that comes up, it seems the page attempts to upload it immediately.


* The webpage gives me a "Filesize Too Big" error. This implies that, while it accepted the jpg, the file was too big. 


Next, I try to upload a smaller file this time in the .png format:


![Invalid filetype error](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/invalid_file.png)


Now I (roughly) know that the webpage will allow me to upload to the server. The next thing I want to do is to get a visual of how the webpage is configured and if there are any filters that might be there.


![Jewel page source pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/page_source.png)


From a quick look, it‚Äôs evident that there are two spots of interest in the page‚Äôs source regarding the filters:


* `<script src="assets/js/upload.js"></script>`
* `<input id="fileSelect" type="file" name="fileToUpload" accept="image/jpeg">`


The second item is easy to bypass: I can simply upload a payload with the jpeg/jpg extension and call it a day. However, the first item tells me that the webpage is employing a script that‚Äôs responsible for filtering. 

Now, at this point, I know that I could look at the upload.js script directly and see what filters are in place and, in a realistic setting, I probably would. But, for the sake of being thorough, I‚Äôm going to figure them out manually.

Since my goal is to upload a payload that‚Äôll get me a reverse shell on the machine, I‚Äôll use `msfvenom` to automatically generate one for me since the payload needs to be in JavaScript and aimed at exploiting Node.js:


![Picture of msfvenom command line](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/msfvenom_payload.png)


Done! Now all that‚Äôs left is to change the extension from `.js` to `.jpg` and see if the file uploads!


![Failed upload pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/invalid_file.png)


Darn. Even though the file has the right extension and is small enough in size, there seems to be yet another parameter being used to check the upload. My suspicion is that it‚Äôs also looking at the file‚Äôs signature (as this was another topic covered in the THM room) and determining if it‚Äôs actually a jpg or not. I‚Äôm going to test this out by editing the hex values and adding the magic numbers that are usually associated with this image format. Wikipedia tells me that there are three different combination of hex values that can used to spoof the file type and, for the sake of ease, I‚Äôll use the shortest one which is `FF D8 FF EE`:


![hexedit pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/hexedit.png)


Save the file and call it good. Let‚Äôs use `file` to see what type of file it appears to be now:


![file command pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/file_command.png)


Okay. The file is now appearing to be jpeg image data. A quick rename from `shell.js` to `shell.jpg` to finish and now I can attempt the upload again:


![file success upload pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/successful_upload.png)


Nice! It seems that adding those magic numbers to spoof the payload‚Äôs signature did the trick. 

***

Before moving onto the next phase, a quick recap is in order: from everything that I‚Äôve done so far, I‚Äôve discovered that files that are being upload are going through filters that scan the extension, size, and file signature of whatever is being uploaded. Remember the `upload.js` from the page source? Let‚Äôs look at it now and see how accurate my results are:


![upload.js code pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/uploadjs_code.png)


There it is; the same three filters I figured were in place are clearly outlined in this script. Again, I could‚Äôve looked at this initially and saved myself some time and effort but‚Ä¶ where‚Äôs the fun in that?


***

### Exploitation:

Since the payload is now uploaded, it‚Äôs time to find and activate it! But‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt where exactly it is. Thankfully, `gobuster` can help me with that:


![gobuster directories pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/gobuster_directories.png)


From this we can deduce that my upload is in one of these four directories (side note: I do know that, from looking at the page source, `/assets` was a folder. `gobuster` confirms this for me). I have a good idea where my payload is but, just out of curiosity, I‚Äôll look at all these directories, starting with `/assets`:


![404 error pic](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/404_page.png)


Bummer. Though `gobuster` sees this folder, it appears that it‚Äôs off-limits. In fact, trying this with both the `/contents` and `/modules` folders yield the same result. But, the `/admin`...


![pic of admin page](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/admin_page.png)


...shows me this. From first glance, it look like an input field where one can write commands to the server. Let‚Äôs see if I can run a simple `ls` command:


![pic of module doesn‚Äôt exist error](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/admin_page_test1_fail.png)


Okay. So I guess that I can only run modules that are contained in the `/modules` folder, or so it says.

At this point, I‚Äôve got the file structure, but I still don‚Äôt know where my file is since I can‚Äôt view the three other folders from the website. Thankfully, `gobuster` can also check for files as well. From the challenge section, we are tipped off to the fact that the server renames all files uploaded to short, random strings and this is evident from the wordlist provided. Plus, since I uploaded my payload as a jpg, I know what I‚Äôm looking for.


![gobuster file command](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/gobuster_file_scan.png)


Here I‚Äôm telling it to scan the `/content` folder and look for any file that has the jpg extension, using the provided wordlist to find files whose names match that of the ones included in said list.


![gobuster scan results](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/gobuster_file_scan_results.png)


There‚Äôs quite a few jpg files here but which one is mine? The results not only show the file itself but also the size. Maybe we can use this to identify which one is my payload. Let's check the details of the payload on my machine:


![stat command results](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/stat_shell.jpg.png)


So I‚Äôm looking for a file that‚Äôs 803 kb in size. We can see from prior results that my file is on the server as `UEB.jpg`. Since I‚Äôm ready to launch the payload, let‚Äôs get netcat running to listen for my reverse shell on port 3388:


![pic of netcat listening](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/netcat_listening.png)


Great! Now I just need to launch the payload. To do this, I‚Äôll head over to the `/admin` page and see if I can maybe run the file as a command:


![pic of admin page w/ command in input field](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/admin_page_test1.png)


And press enter. Let‚Äôs see what happens:


![pic of first fail](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/admin_page_test1_fail.png)

That‚Äôs odd. The script is clearly on the server and should be running but, for some reason, nothing happens and netcat shows that no connection has been made.

After doing some thinking, I hypothesized that the problem might be due to the magic numbers that I inserted into the beginning of the code within the file. Usually, when code is being executed, the first line (that‚Äôs not a comment) always begins the set of instructions sent to the machine.


![pic of special chars in payload](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/shell_magic_numbers_chars.png)


These odd-looking characters in the file are no doubt a representation of the magic numbers that I placed into the file to make it appear to be a jpeg image. Yet, these same characters are probably getting in the way of the execution of the actual code. Removing these characters will undo some work but it should allow the payload to execute.

But that raises another problem: if I restore the file signature, the file itself won‚Äôt pass the client-side filter. Since this can probably only work if I leave the contents of the script alone (i.e. don‚Äôt append magic numbers to it), I‚Äôll have to find another way of getting around the filter.

This is where I return to Burp Suite. I recall from the lesson room that I can intercept a page before it loads and modify the source before it renders on my browser.


![burp page source intercept](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/burp_response_page_source.png)


So now I‚Äôll take this section‚Ä¶


![pic of area of interest](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/before_page_modification.png)


‚Ä¶and remove the middle line.


![pic of modified area](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/after_page_modification.png)


Then forward the request.


![page modified](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/page_modified.png)

Cool. The page loaded. Now to upload the payload‚Ä¶


...
...


Huh. Nothing happens when I click the ‚ÄúSelect and Upload‚Äù button. Oops. I broke the upload function. üòÇ

Okay so that method isn‚Äôt going to work; the site relies on that script to allow the user to upload a file so removing it is out of the question.

By now, I‚Äôve tried conforming to the filters and removing the filters, but both have failed. My last option would be to bypass the filters. But how would I do that?

Looking back on what I was taught, it is possible intercept a legit upload and change the contents midway, thus bypassing the local filtering. Time to see what an honest upload looks like in Burp.


![honest upload](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/honest_upload.png)


Here we are. We can see the name, MIME type, and the data itself contained within this legitimate jpeg that I‚Äôm uploading. There‚Äôs no reason to change the first two but the data itself is something that I can work with. For the third field, we see that there‚Äôs something at the beginning of all that gibberish that gives us a clue: `data:image/jpeg;base64,`. Aside from it telling us what it is (we know that already), this is indicating that all the data that constitutes the picture is going over encoded in base64. And since I can modify the contents of the file before letting it get to the server, maybe I can overwrite the image with my payload? Let‚Äôs give it a shot.


Copying the contents of my payload, I‚Äôll head over to a website that can encode text to base64.


![base64 encoding](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/base64_encoding.png)


On the top is my input (the payload) and the bottom is the output (the payload encoded in base64). With this, I should be able to copy and paste it right into the body of the file and then forward the request.


![file successfully uploaded](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/successful_upload.png)


Cool! The upload made it to the server. Now I just need to run gobuster again to find the file I need to run.


![gobuster results 2](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/gobuster_file_scan_results_2.png)


Comparing this to the previous scan, I can immediately tell which is the new file: `XTB.jpg`. All that‚Äôs left is to head back over to `/admin` and try to run the payload again!


![admin page w/ new command](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/admin_page_test2.png)

The webpage is taking longer than a second to load. Without looking at my terminal, this already tells that the code must be executing. What does netcat have for us‚Ä¶


![netcat establishes the connection](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/netcat_connection.png)


Eureka! My reverse shell is open, and I now have remote access! Let‚Äôs see what we got.

![netcat commands](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/netcat_commands.png)

I‚Äôm logged in as root, my home directory is `/var/www/html/`, and I can see five folders and two files. Great! Now, the challenge stated that my flag is in `/var/www/`.


![netcat ls of /var/www](/blastermans-base/assets/images/write_ups/tryhackme/upload_vulns/netcat_ls_varwww.png)


Bingo. All that remains now is to cat the text file and take the flag! Victory!

I have to say that I had fun taking on this challenge and completing the Upload Vulnerabilities room on TryHackMe. It was difficult but it forced me to think creatively and outside-the-box in order to get around the security measures and gain remote access. It took some time but the process of trial-and-error that eventually led to my victory gave a sense of accomplishment. I daresay that, if this final challenge hadn‚Äôt been included, I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve walked away from this lesson with as strong an understanding of these concepts as I did. As such, I am very grateful to MuirlandOracle for taking the time to make this room.

Now that I finished this, it‚Äôs time to see what else TryHackMe has in store for me. üòé
